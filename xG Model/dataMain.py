#* 1. Quality Control
#   *1a. clean training and testing data
#   *1b. confirm that resulting dataframes are of the correcct dimensions by checking their shapes

train, trainOG = cleanTrain(Euro) # clean training data set
print(train.shape) # check shape

test1, test = cleanTest(oxyplayerdata) # clean test data set
print(test.shape) # check shape

OxyData = test1 # clean data set for later use
print(OxyData.shape) #check shape


#* 2. Model Execution
#   *2a. split the data into training and test sets
#   *2b. run MoBot on training and test input

#* 3. DataFrame Preparation
#   *3a. Add prediction data to previously cleaned dataframe
#   *3b. Create a separate, duplicate dataframe for additional performance analysis
#       *3b.1. Sort and separate dataframe to only include Occidental College shot information
#   *3c.

# 4. Upload prediction data to Google Sheets
